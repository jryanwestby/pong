# pong
Clone of the classic game Pong, written in Python and Pygame using OOP.

Created by following [Trevor Appleton and Webucator's blog post ](http://trevorappleton.blogspot.com/2015/04/refactoring-pong-using-object-oriented.html) while adding my own flavor based on my pong preferences.

Features to be added:
- Title screen
- Variable speeds based on spot of collision with paddle
- Options for a second set of paddles on the floor and ceiling, one AI and one controller by arrow keys
- Option to choose amount of balls
- Need to fix bug where ball gets stuck inside paddle's rectangle
- Add sound effects
